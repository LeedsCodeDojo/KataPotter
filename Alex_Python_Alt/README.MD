I wasn't able to attend this month's Dojo but thought I'd have a go at a solution in Python in my own time.

I initially took a copy of Scott & Gordon's solution to get the approximate logic and unit tests in place, but have ended up taking quite a different approach with my final version.

Thanks to everyone who posted code - I'll see you next time for some code golf!
